# DSDN

**DSDN (Distributed Storage & Data Network)** is an experimental distributed
data and compute infrastructure designed to be verifiable-by-design.

## Status
⚠️ **Experimental / Work in Progress**  
Not production ready. APIs, state model, and architecture may change at any time.

## Goals
- Deterministic state reconstruction from Data Availability logs
- Content-addressed storage with multi-zone replication
- Secure sandboxed compute (WASM / microVM)
- Minimal trust assumptions across nodes, coordinators, and validators

## Non-Goals (for now)
- Production deployment
- Stable public API
- Backward compatibility guarantees
